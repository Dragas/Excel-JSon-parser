# Excel-JSon-parser
Parses JSON from excel sheets.

Pretty self explanitory.
Prompts for property range and data range and recurrent method allows you to parse several tables of data from the same file into same JSON file.
Does not really work if you're trying to parse unevenly merged cells for example
